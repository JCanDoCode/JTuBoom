# Welcome to JTuBoom!

JTuBoom is a play on words for YouTube, since this project revolves around uploading to youtube. This is a project that will be built upon to represent my skills in APIs, Databases, React, TypeScript, Python, Node, and more!

I recently changed my personal branding from JCanArt, to Josel Canlas (my name). This is a send off for my last business name to my new personal branding! JCanArt is still a name I hold dear, with many great memories. However, it is time to begin a new project brought to you by a new "name".
